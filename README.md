Concepts:

1) Locators : Identifying elements on a web page using attributes like ID, Name, 
 Class, Tag Name, Link Text, Partial Link Text, CSS Selector, XPath.

2) Relative Locators : Relative locators are a set of methods that allow you to 
locate elements based on their relationship with other nearby elements.
i) above() : Finds an element located above the specified element.
 Ex : driver.findElement(with(By.Tagname(" ")).above());
ii) below(): Finds an element located below the specified element.
 Ex : driver.findElement(with(By.Tagname(" ")).below());
iii) toLeftOf(): Finds an element located to the left of the specified element.
 Ex : driver.findElement(with(By.Tagname(" ")).toLeftOf());
iv) toRightOf(): Finds an element located to the right of the specified element.
 Ex : driver.findElement(with(By.Tagname(" ")).toRightOf());
v) near(): Finds an element located near (any direction) the specified element.
 Ex : driver.findElement(with(By.Tagname(" ")).near());

3) WebDriver: A tool to automate web browsers, like Chrome or Firefox, for testing 
web applications.
Example : WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver();

4) Web Element Interactions : Performing actions like clicking buttons, entering 
text into input fields, selecting dropdown options.
Example : webElement.click() or webElement.sendKeys("text");

5) Handling Waits : Waiting for certain conditions before performing actions, like 
waiting for an element to be visible.

6) Handling Alerts and Pop-ups : Dealing with browser alert boxes or pop-up windows
generated by JavaScript.
Example: 
// Switch to Alert : Alert alert = driver.switchTo().alert();
// Accepting an Alert : alert.accept();
// Dismissing an Alert : alert.dismiss();
// Getting Text from Alert : String alertText = alert.getText();

7) Frames and Windows : Dealing with HTML frames and managing multiple browser 
windows or tabs.
Example : driver.switchTo().frame("frameName");

8) Handling Dynamic Elements : Handling elements that change attributes or 
positions on the web page.
 Example : Using dynamic XPath or CSS selectors.

9) Handling Forms and Tables : Interacting with form elements like input fields and
buttons, and extracting data from HTML tables.
Example : webElement.submit() or extracting table data using XPath.

10) Handling Cookies: Managing browser cookies during test execution.
Example : driver.manage().getCookies();

11) Page Object Model (POM): Design pattern for creating object-oriented test code,
separating page elements and actions into classes.
Example : Creating a LoginPage class with methods like enterUsername() and clickLoginButton();

Types of Methods in Selenium : 
Navigation Methods : These methods are used for navigating between different web pages.
Examples : get(), navigate().to(), navigate().back(), navigate().forward(),navigate().refresh().
 
driver.get(" "); / driver.navigate().to(" "); / js.executeScript("window.open('https://example.com');");
driver.navigate().back(" "); / ((JavascriptExecutor)driver).executeScript("window.history.back();");
driver.navigate().forward(" "); / ((JavascriptExecutor)driver).executeScript("window.history.forward();");
driver.navigate().refresh(" "); / ((JavascriptExecutor)driver).executeScript("history.go(0);"); 

Element Location Methods : These methods are used for finding web elements within a web page.
Examples : findElement(), findElements().

Element Interaction Methods : These methods are used for interacting with web elements, such as clicking, typing, or retrieving information.
Examples : click(), sendKeys(), getText(), getAttribute(), isEnabled(), isSelected(), submit(), clear().

Browser Management Methods : These methods are used for managing the browser window or session.
Examples: close(), quit().

Alert Handling Methods : These methods are used for handling JavaScript alerts, prompts, and confirmations.
Examples : switchTo().alert(), accept(), dismiss().

Window Handling Methods : These methods are used for handling multiple browser windows or tabs.
Examples : getWindowHandle(), getWindowHandles().

Wait Methods : These methods are used for waiting for certain conditions to be met before proceeding with the test execution.
Examples : Implicit Wait, Explicit Wait, Fluent Wait.

Screenshot Methods : These methods are used for capturing screenshots of the browser window or specific elements.
Example: getScreenshotAs().

Cookie Handling Methods : These methods are used for handling browser cookies.
Examples : getCookies(), addCookie(), deleteCookieName(), deleteAllCookies().

 driver.manage().deleteCookieName();
 driver.manage().deleteAllCookies();
 
Frame and iFrame Handling Methods : These methods are used for interacting with frames and iframes within a web page.
Examples: driver.switchTo().frame(), driver.switchTo().defaultContent().

1) What is Selenium? Why is it used?
A. Selenium is a popular open-source automation testing tool used for automating web browsers. 
i) It's widely adopted in the software industry for functional testing of web applications across different browsers and platforms.
ii) Selenium provides a suite of tools that cater to various testing needs,including Selenium WebDriver for browser automation,
Selenium IDE for record-and-playback testing, Selenium Grid for parallel test execution.
Its versatility, cross-browser compatibility, and support for multiple programming languages make it a preferred choice for automating web application testing.

2) How does Selenium Webdriver works?
A. Selenium Webdriver interacts with the web browser or remote server. It sends the command to retrieve the results.

3) Limitations of Selenium?
A. Limited Support for testing desktop applications.
 Limited Support for mobile testing.
 No-built in reporting capabilities.
 No-built in support for image-based testing.
 Browser compatability issues.
 Challenges with CAPTCHA and OTP.

4) What are the different components of Selenium?
A. Selenium consists of several components:
Selenium WebDriver: A powerful tool for automating web browsers and interacting with web elements.
Selenium IDE : A Firefox plugin for record-and-playback testing.
Selenium Grid : Allows parallel execution of tests across multiple browsers and platforms.
Selenium Remote : Control (RC): A deprecated component replaced by WebDriver.
Selenium Server : Facilitates communication between WebDriver and the browser drivers.

5) What are the different types of locators in Selenium?
A. Selenium provides various locators to identify elements on a web page:
ID : It takes a string parameter which is a value of the ID attribute which returns the object to findElement() method.
Ex : driver.findElement(By.id(“user”));

Name : The first element with the name attribute value matching the location will be returned.
Ex : driver.findElement(By.name(“books”).click;

Class Name : This finds elements based on the value of the CLASS attribute. If an element has many classes then this will match against each of them. 
Ex : driver.findElement(By.className(“inputtext”));

Tag Name : Locates all the elements with the matching tag name
Ex : driver.findElement(By.tagName(“button”).click());

Link Text : If your targeted element is a link text then you can use the by.linkText locator to locate that element.
Ex : driver.findElement(By.linkText(“Today’s deals”)).click();

Partial Link Text : The target link can be located using a portion of text in a link text element.
Ex : driver.findElement(By.linkText(“Service”)).click();

XPath : It takes a parameter of String which is a XPATHEXPRESSION and it returns an object to findElement() method. 
Ex : driver.findElement(By.xpath(“//TagName[contains(text(),’an account’)]”)).getText();
Syntax's : 
// (By.xpath("//Tagname[@class='Value']"));
// (By.xpath("//Tagname[@class='Value'][Index]"));
// (By.xpath("//*[@class='searchWhat form-control']")); --> Exact Value
// (By.xpath("//*[contains(@class, 'searchWhat form-control')]")); --> Partial Value

CSS Selector : Locates elements based on the driver’s underlying CSS selector engine. 
Ex: driver.findElement(By.cssSelector(“input#email”)).sendKeys(“myemail@email.com”);
Syntax's :
// By.cssSelector(Tagname[attribute='value']);
// By.cssSelector("Tagname[attribute='value']:nth-child(Index));
// By.cssSelector("Tagname.attributevalue");
// By.cssSelector("Tagname#attributevalue");
// By.cssSelector("[class*='searchWhat form-control']");
// By.cssSelector("[class='searchWhat form-control']");

6) How to find the number of tag?
A. List<WebElement> div = driver.findElements(By.tagName("a"));
 int num = div.size();
 System.out.println(num);

7) When do we use List & Set in Selenium?
A. In Selenium, both Lists and Sets can be useful for handling collections of web elements, but they serve different purposes depending on the context.
 List: A List is an ordered collection of elements that allows duplicates.
 In Selenium, when you find multiple web elements using a locator strategy like findElements, Selenium returns a List of WebElement objects.
 You can then iterate over this list to perform actions on each element.
 
 Set: A Set is a collection that does not allow duplicates. 
 In Selenium, you might use a Set to store unique elements such as unique links found on a webpage. 
 This can be useful when you want to ensure that you are not processing duplicate elements. 
 
8) Difference between ArrayList and LinkedList?
A) ArrayList : ArrayList uses a dynamic array to store elements.
 Elements are stored in contiguous memory locations, which allows for fast random access to elements using their index.
 However, adding or removing elements from the middle of the list can be inefficient since it requires shifting elements to accommodate the change in size.
 Ex : ArrayList<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
 // Adding elements
 list.add("Apple");
 System.out.println("ArrayList after adding elements: " + list);

 // Adding element at specific index
 list.add(1, "Mango");
 System.out.println("ArrayList after adding Mango at index 1: " + list);
 
 // Removing element at specific index
 list.remove(2);
 System.out.println("ArrayList after removing element at index 2: " + list);
 
 // Clearing the ArrayList
 list.clear();
 System.out.println("ArrayList after clearing: " + list);
 LinkedList : LinkedList uses a doubly linked list data structure to store elements.
 Each element is stored in a separate node, and each node contains a reference to the previous and next nodes in the list.
 This structure makes adding or removing elements from the middle of the list more efficient compared to ArrayList since it only requires updating the references of neighboring nodes.
 Ex : LinkedList<String> list = new LinkedList<>();
 // Adding elements
 list.add("Apple");
 
 // Adding element at the beginning
 list.addFirst("Mango");
 System.out.println("LinkedList after adding Mango at the beginning: " + list);
 
 // Removing first and last elements
 String first = list.removeFirst();
 String last = list.removeLast();
 
9) Explain the difference between findElement() and findElements() methods?
A. FindElement() : Used to locate the first web element matching the specified locator strategy. If no element is found, it throws a NoSuchElementException.
   FindElements() : Returns a list of web elements matching the specified locator strategy. If no elements are found, it returns an empty list.
10) What is WebDriver? How do you instantiate WebDriver in Selenium?
A. WebDriver is an interface in Selenium used for automating web browsers. 
   It provides methods to interact with web elements and control browser behavior. 
   To instantiate WebDriver, you need to create an object of a specific browser driver class, such as ChromeDriver, FirefoxDriver, etc. 
Ex: WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver();

11) How to create Remote WebDriver?
A. 
 // Set desired capabilities for the browser
DesiredCapabilities capabilities = DesiredCapabilities.chrome();

 // Set the URL of the Selenium Grid Hub
String hubUrl = "http://grid_hub_ip:4444/wd/hub"; // Replace with actual hub URL

 // Create Remote WebDriver instance 
WebDriver driver = new RemoteWebDriver(new URL(hubUrl), capabilities);

 // Now you can use 'driver' to interact with the browser remotely
 driver.get("https://www.example.com");
 System.out.println("Page title: " + driver.getTitle());
 driver.quit();
 
12) How do you handle dynamic elements in Selenium?
A. Dynamic elements are those whose attributes or positions change dynamically.
   To handle them, you can use dynamic locators like XPath or CSS selectors that are less likely to change, or wait for the element to become stable using explicit waits with conditions like visibility or presence.

13) What are the types of waits supported by WebDriver?
A. Types of waits : 
I) Implicit wait - Implicit wait commands Selenium to wait for a certain amount of time before throwing a “No such element” exception.
Ex : driver.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(5, TimeUnit.SECONDS);

II) Explicit wait - Explicit wait is used to tell the Web Driver to wait for certain conditions before throwing an
                   "ElementNotVisibleException", "TimeoutException", "NoSuchElementException","ElementNotInteractableException","WebDriverException" exception. 
 It's applied to specific elements and allows waiting for conditions like element visibility, presence, or clickability.
Ex : WebDriverWait wait = new WebDriverWait(driver, 10);
 WebElement element = wait.until(ExpectedConditions.visibilityOfElementLocated(By.linkText("Understood")));
                                                  or 
 WebElement element = wait.until(ExpectedConditions.presenceOfElementLocated(By.linkText("Understood")));
 
III) Fluent wait - It is used to tell the web driver to wait for a condition, as well as the frequency with which we want to check the condition before throwing an "ElementNotVisibleException" exception. 
                  Fluent Wait is a type of explicit wait in Selenium WebDriver that provides more flexibility in defining the polling interval and the conditions to wait for.
Ex: Wait wait = new FluentWait(WebDriver reference).withTimeout(timeout, SECONDS).pollingEvery(timeout, SECONDS).ignoring(Exception.class); 
                     or 
 Wait<WebDriver> wait = new FluentWait<>(driver)
                       .withTimeout(Duration.ofSeconds(30)) // Maximum time to wait
                       .pollingEvery(Duration.ofSeconds(5)) // Frequency of checking
                       .ignoring(Exception.class);
 WebElement element = wait.until(driver -> driver.findElement(By.id("element_id")));
 
13) How to take screenshots?
A. File screenshot = ((TakesScreenshot)driver).getScreenshotAs(OutputType.FILE);
   Files.copy(screenshot.toPath(),new File("screenshot.png").toPath(),StandardCopyOption.REPLACE_EXISTING);
                       or 
 File DestinationFile = new File("screenshot.png");
 Files.copy(screenshot.toPath(), DestinationFile.toPath(),StandardCopyOption.REPLACE_EXISTING);
 System.out.println("Screenshot saved to " + DestinationFile.getAbsolutePath());

 By using JavascriptExecutor Class:
 JavascriptExecutor js = (JavascriptExecutor) driver;
 TakesScreenshot ts = (TakesScreenshot) driver;
 String screenshot = (String) js.executeScript("return document.documentElement.outerHTML");
 try {
 File screenshotFile = ts.getScreenshotAs(OutputType.FILE);
 System.out.println(screenshotFile.getAbsolutePath());
 }
 catch(Exception e){
 System.err.println("Failed to capture screenshot: " + e.getMessage());
 }
 finally {
 Thread.sleep(1000);
 driver.quit();
 }
 
14) How to handle Scroll Down?
A. By using Actions Class & JavascriptExecutor
 
 By using Actions Class:
 Actions actions = new Actions(driver);
// actions.keyDown(Keys.CONTROL).sendKeys(Keys.END).perform();
 actions.sendKeys(Keys.END).perform();
 Thread.sleep(1000);
 actions.sendKeys(Keys.HOME).perform();
 Thread.sleep(1000);
 By using JavascriptExecutor Class:
 JavascriptExecutor js = (JavascriptExecutor) driver;
 js.executeScript("window.scrollBy(0,1000)"); // ---> for scroll down
 js.executeScript("window.scrollTo(0,0)"); // ---> for scroll up
 Thread.sleep(1000);
 
15) How do you handle multiple browser windows or tabs in Selenium?
A. You can handle multiple browser windows or tabs using WebDriver's switchTo() 
method to switch between windows or tabs. You can use both for loop & 
JavaScriptExecutor to switch the windows or tabs.
 Using For Loop by two Ways:
 
 // Should get current window handle
 String currentWindowHandle = driver.getWindowHandle();
 // after switched to new window
 for (String windowhandles : driver.getWindowHandles())
 { 
 driver.switchTo().window(currentWindowHandle);
 }
 or 
// Set<String> windowhandles = driver.getWindowHandles();
 for(String windowhandle : driver.getWindowHandles())
 {
 if(!windowhandle.equals(currentWindowHandle))
 {
 driver.switchTo().window(currentWindowHandle);
 }
// By Using by JavaScriptExecutor:
 JavascriptExecutor js1 = (JavascriptExecutor)driver;
 for(String windowhandle : driver.getWindowHandles())
 {
 js1.executeScript("window.open(arguments[0])",windowhandle);
 }
 
16) How to add the urls to the list and to handle the windows by switching?
A. 
// By adding urls to list array
 List<String> urls = new ArrayList<>();
 urls.add("https://www.kreditbee.in/"); 
 
 JavascriptExecutor js = (JavascriptExecutor) driver;
 for (String url : urls) 
 {
 js.executeScript("window.open(arguments[0])", urls);
 }
 driver.switchTo().window(driver.getWindowHandle());
 
17) Explain the Page Object Model (POM) and its advantages?
A. Page Object Model (POM) is a design pattern in Selenium for creating repository for web elements.
i) It involves creating separate classes for each web page or component, encapsulating page elements and their actions within these classes.
ii) Advantages include improved code maintainability, reusability, and readability, as well as reduced code duplication.

Key Concepts of POM:
Page Classes : Each web page in the application is represented by a separate class.
 The class contains web elements (fields) and methods (functions) that interact with these elements.
Web Elements : Web elements on the page (such as text boxes, buttons, links) are defined in the Page class using locators 
 (e.g., @FindBy annotations in Java).
Methods : Methods in the Page class perform operations on the web elements, such as clicking a button or entering text in a field. 
 These methods encapsulate the logic for interacting with the page.

19) How do you handle alerts and pop-ups in Selenium?
A. You can handle alerts and pop-ups in Selenium using methods provided by 
WebDriver's Alert interface, such as accept(), dismiss(), getText().
// Clicking on a button to trigger an alert
 driver.findElement(By.id("alertButton")).click();
// Switch to the alert
 Alert alert = driver.switchTo().alert();
 
// Get the text of the alert
 String alertText = alert.getText();
 System.out.println("Alert Text: " + alertText);
// Accept the alert
 alert.accept(); 
 or 
 ((JavascriptExecutor)driver).executeScript("alert('Hello World!');");
// Dismiss the alert
 alert.dismiss();
 or
 ((JavascriptExecutor)driver).executeScript("confirm('Are you sure?');");
 Handling prompt boxes
// SendKeys to the prompt box
 alert.sendKeys("Text to be entered");
 
19) What are the advantages of using TestNG with Selenium?
A. TestNG is a testing framework that provides additional functionalities like grouping, parameterization, parallel execution, and reporting capabilities, which enhance Selenium test automation.
 It allows better organization and management of test cases, simplifies test execution, and provides detailed test reports.

31) What is the difference between driver.get() and driver.navigate().to() methods?
A. driver.get(): Navigates to a URL and waits for the page to load completely.
   driver.navigate().to(): Navigates to a URL without waiting for the page to load completely.
 It allows additional navigation options like forward(), back(), refresh().

33) How do you handle cookies in Selenium?
A. You can handle cookies in Selenium using methods provided by WebDriver's Options interface, such as addCookie(), deleteCookie(), deleteAllCookies(), etc.

35) Explain the difference between CSS Selector and XPath?
A. CSS Selector : Uses CSS syntax to locate elements on a web page. It's generally faster and more readable than XPath. 
 XPath : Uses XML path expressions to locate elements based on their attributes, position, or relationship with other elements.
 It's more powerful but can be slower and less readable than CSS Selector.

37) What are the different types of annotations which are used in Selenium?
A. Different types of annotations that are used in Selenium include:
@BeforeSuite : This annotation is used to mark a method that should run before any tests in the suite.
@AfterSuite : This annotation is used to mark a method that should run after all tests in the suite have been run.
@BeforeTest : This annotation is used to mark a method that should run before any test method belonging to the classes inside the <test> tag is run.
@AfterTest : This annotation is used to mark a method that should run after all the test methods belonging to the classes inside the <test> tag have run.
@Test : This annotation is used to mark a method as a test method
@BeforeMethod: This annotation is used to execute a method before each test method
@AfterMethod : This annotation is used to execute a method after each test method
@BeforeClass : This annotation is used to execute a method before the first test method.
@AfterClass : This annotation is used to mark a method that should run after all the test methods in the current class have been run.

39) What are the testing types supported by Selenium? 
A. Selenium supports Regression testing and Functional testing. 
Regression testing - It is a full or partial selection of already executed test cases that are re-executed to ensure existing functionalities work fine.

The steps involved are - 
Re-testing : All tests in the existing test suite are executed. It proves to be very expensive and time-consuming.
Regression testing : Tests are classified as feature tests, integration tests, and the end to end tests.

In this step, some of the tests are selected.
Prioritization of test cases: The selected test cases are prioritized based on business impact and critical functionalities.
Functional testing - Functional Testing involves the verification of every function of the application with the required specification.

 Assert.assertEquals(Expected_title,actual_title);
 or
 if(actual_title.equals("Job search | Search and apply for a new job | 
WhatJobs")){
 System.out.println("Title validation passed");
 }
 else {
 System.out.println("Title validation failed");
 }
 driver.quit();
 or 
 if(Expected_title==actual_title){
 System.out.println("Title is correct");
 }
 else{
 System.out.println("Title is not correct");
 }
 
50) What do you mean by the assertion in Selenium?
A. An assertion is a method of testing whether a particular condition is true or false. 
 In Selenium, assertions are used to verify the state of elements on a page or the results of an action. 
 Assertions can be used to check for the presence or absence of an element, the value of an element, or the text of an element.
 Assertions can also be used to check that an element is visible or hidden.
 Assertions are an important part of testing with Selenium, as they enable you to verify that the state of your application meets your expectations.
 Without assertions, it would be difficult to know whether or not your tests are actually passing or failing.
